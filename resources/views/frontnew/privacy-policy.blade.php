                        <p>Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy or in the Data Protection Addendum, we will only use personally identifiable information for the purposes described above, or as otherwise disclosed at the time we request such information from you. You must "opt in" and give us permission to use your personally identifiable information for any other purpose. You may also change your preference and "opt out" of receiving certain marketing communications from us by clicking the unsubscribe link included at the bottom of all such communications, or by <a href="mailto:info@slikk.ai" style="color:#5433FF;">contacting us via email</a>.</p><br>
                        <p><b style="color:black;">Do Not Track</b><br>
                        The term "Do Not Track" refers to an HTTP header offered by certain web browsers to request that websites refrain from tracking the user. We take no action in response to Do Not Track requests.

                        <p><b style="color:black;">Can I update or correct my personally identifiable information?</b><br>
                        The rights you have to request updates or corrections to the information slikk collects depend on your relationship with slikk. Personnel may update or correct their information as detailed in our internal company employment policies.
                        </p>
                        <p>Customers have the right to request the restriction of certain uses and disclosures of personally identifiable information as follows.

Promptly after receiving your request, all personal information stored in databases we actively use, and other readily searchable media will be updated, corrected, changed or deleted, as appropriate, as soon as and to the extent reasonably and technically practicable.</p>
